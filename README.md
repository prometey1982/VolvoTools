Tools for flashing and logging ME7 and ME9 memory with J2534 devices.
Initially written by dream3R from http://nefariousmotorsports.com/forum
for Hilton's Tuning Studio. 
HTL was decompiled and rewritten in C++.
Later was added support of generic J2534 devices not only DiCE
and support of UDS protocol.

Now supports
- ME7 flashing and logging for P80 and P2
- ME9 flashing and logging for P1
- ME9 and other UDS protocols flashing and logging
